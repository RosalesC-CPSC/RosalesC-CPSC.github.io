## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7 Part 1

    I found this lab assignment interesting and somewhat complicated, even though it only consisted of one part. Me and my partner for this lab were astonished of the amount of "if" statements following one another in an almost consecutive sequence. Despite the complexity, we found it easy to input the correct terms in each if statement this assignment asked us to write.

* Lab 8 Part 1

    I found this lab assignment to be interesting as it involved the use of "double" statements, as well as the use of "for" and "if" statements. My partner and I initially struggled with the formatting with the double statements, but later found it understandable and repetitive, making it easier to code.

* Lab 11 Part 1

    This lab assignment in particular had both me and my partner stumped when writing the code. Not only did it involve the use of "if" and "while" statements, but also "break" and having to make a class with "public" and "private" data. Needless to say, this lab was interesting with the introduction of the use of classes and having to write public and private data for our given scenario: states and population.
